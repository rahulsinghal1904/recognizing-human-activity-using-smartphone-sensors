# recognizing-human-activity-using-smartphone-sensors
This project aims to identify and classify different human activities using different machine learning models and then finding the most suitable one on the base of accuracy and features available. Features are obtained by the readings gathered from Accelerator (measures acceleration) and Gyroscope (measures angular velocity) which are sensors fitted in Smartphones with the help of 30 volunteers. Understanding human activities can come handy in the health sector, especially in rehabilitation, elder care support services and cognitive impairment.
